Platform specific portions:
- Monitor sleep
- Detect Monitor woken up by user mouse movement
- input idle time or set input idleness timer
- process sleep
- filesystem access for logfile and creating config dir.
   also, finding suitable home directory to store conf dir.
- time epoch

Other TODO items:
- termination signal handler.
- logging
- use strings instead of indices to identify audio devices to allow for device
   removal or addition.  Also, hide OSS devices because their names change.
- fix memory leaks
- Only works with Portaudio 1.9, which is only in the bleeding edge distros
- must create ~/.sonarPM manually
- sonar playback oscillator crackles every so often.  Fix this somehow.
