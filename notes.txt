Platform specific portions:
- Monitor sleep
- Detect Monitor woken up by user mouse movement
- input idle time or set input idleness timer
- process sleep
- filesystem access for logfile and creating config dir.
   also, finding suitable home directory to store conf dir.
- time epoch

Other TODO items:
- termination signal handler.
- logging
- use strings instead of indices to identify audio devices to allow for device
   removal or addition.  Also, hide OSS devices because their names change.
- fix memory leaks
- Only works with Portaudio 1.9, which is only in the bleeding edge distros
- create ~/.sonarPM directory to store all associated files
- sonar playback oscillator crackles every so often.  Fix this somehow.
- user's volume settings will affect calibration.  Can we solve this by using ration of delta to mean in recording?

mingw32 notes:
- must compile portaudio.a first:
  - requires pthread: yum install mingw32-pthreads, then:
     cd /usr/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/
     sudo ln -s libpthreadGC2.a libpthread.a
  - wget http://portaudio.com/archives/pa_stable_v19_20071207.tar.gz
  - cd portaudio; mingw32-env; cp ../Makefile.portaudio-mingw32 Makefile; make
- to build sonar: run mingw32-env; make
- In Vista and later, WmiMonitorBrightnessMethods can be used to set LCD bright
- In XP there is http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa372656(VS.85).aspx
